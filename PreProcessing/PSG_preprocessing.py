### Preprocessing stages:
# 1. apply bandpass filter from 0.3 to 40 Hz
# 2. downsample (optional) from 400 to 100 Hz
# 3. rereference (to linked mastoids for now, can be changed)
# 4. import hypnogram and upsample to equal the sampling rate of the eeg data. the hypnogram vector should be the same length as the eeg
# 5. separate the eeg into REM and NREM stages based on the hypnogram. Any non-continuous portions will be separated into their own epochs
# 6. epoch the data again so that all epochs are 15 seconds. 
# 7. reject artifacts using covariance-based method that yasa provides

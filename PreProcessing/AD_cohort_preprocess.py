## This is a slightly modified version of the original PSG preprocessing pipeline that was created for the PSP cohort. 
## This one is meant to process data from the AD cohort. The only difference is this has a different electrode montage (more of them).

## IMPORTANT! The user must make sure that every patient with a PSG file also contains a corresponding hypnogram! 
## Each PSG file should have a corresponding hypnogram for every step of processing and analysis from here on out!

### Preprocessing stages:
# 1. apply bandpass filter from 0.3 to 50 Hz
# 2. downsample from 400 to 100 Hz
# 3. rereference (to linked mastoids for now, can be changed)
# 4. import hypnogram and upsample to equal the sampling rate of the eeg data. 
# 5. the length of the hypnogram is matched to the length of the PSG data. 
#  ******* IMPORTANT ********  Step #5 often does not work and will at some point require the user to visually inspect the data to be sure this was done properly
# 6. OPTIONAL (recommended for limiting to overnight analysis) -- trim data from 9pm to 9am (to exclude confounds of potential naps during day)
# 7. label artifacts using 'yasa.art_detect' and selecting the "covariance-based" parameter (portions of the hypnogram are labeled '-1' to denote a segment that contains artifact)
#    THRESHOLD IS SET TO 3 ZSCORES FOR ART DETECTION -- THIS CAN BE CHANGED ON LINES 182 AND 187 (CHANGE IT ON BOTH IF YOU"RE GOING TO CHANGE IT AT ALL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)
# 
# NOTE: PSG data are NOT epoched -- they are kept continuous

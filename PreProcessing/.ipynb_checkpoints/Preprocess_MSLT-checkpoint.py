## this lil script will preprocess the MSLT data from the PSP/CBS/other NDD study. For this to work properly, each participant needs their own subfolder within a larger directory. Each subject's folder should contain hypnograms and PSG files from each trial. Trials in which the participant did not sleep should have 'no sleep' in the PSG file name. Trials should be indicated by 'T1' or 'T2', etc... in the file name. 

## The script will more or less follow the same preprocessing steps as the overnight PSG processing pipeline. Those steps are as follows:
# 1. apply bandpass filter from 0.3 to 50 Hz
# 2. downsample from 400 to 100 Hz
# 3. rereference (to linked mastoids for now, can be changed)
# 4. import hypnogram and upsample to equal the sampling rate of the eeg data. 
# 5. the length of the hypnogram is matched to the length of the PSG data. 
#  ******* IMPORTANT ********  Step #5 often does not work and will at some point require the user to visually inspect the data to be sure this was done properly
# 6. label artifacts using 'yasa.art_detect' and selecting the "covariance-based" parameter (portions of the hypnogram are labeled '-1' to denote a segment that contains artifact)
#    THRESHOLD IS SET TO 3 ZSCORES FOR ART DETECTION -- THIS CAN BE CHANGED ON LINES XXX AND XXX (CHANGE IT ON BOTH IF YOU"RE GOING TO CHANGE IT AT ALL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)
# 
# NOTE: PSG data are NOT epoched -- they are kept continuous 

# IF there is no sleep, the hypnogram will not be imported (was not exported from Prana in this study, so nothing to import). However, we will need a hypnogram for artifact rejection. So if there's no sleep in a trial, we'll make our own hypnogram that is the same length as the PSG data (it will be all 0's at first), and then if there is an artifact in a segment of data, we will label that in the newly created hypnogram as '-1'.

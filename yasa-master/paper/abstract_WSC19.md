## Abstract

YASA (Yet Another Spindle Algorithm) is a fast and open-source sleep spindles and slow-waves detection toolbox written in Python 3 and released under the BSD 3 license. YASA is based on state-of-the-art methods and provides several convenient features to integrate the detection of spindles and slow-waves as part of an analysis pipeline. Some of its main features include: efficient multi-channel detection, seamless integration with the most widely-used Python packages for EEG analysis and visualization (e.g. MNE, Visbrain), and built-in automatic rejection of pseudo-events based on machine-learning. In addition, YASA also extracts a collection of parameters to precisely describe the morphology of each detected spindles and/or slow-waves. YASA comes with an extensive documentation, which is available, together with its source code, on GitHub at https://github.com/raphaelvallat/yasa
